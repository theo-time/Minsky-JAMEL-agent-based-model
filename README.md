# Minsky-JAMEL-agent-based-model

This projecs aims to build an Macroeconomic Agent Based Model (MABM) in Javascript, mainly to study the dynamics of financialization and the cyclicality of the financial system. 
Contrary to aggregate models, ABMs  enable complex non-linear dynamics to emerge out of the decentralized interaction of a multiplicity of autonomous agents.

The model is composed of 4 types of agents (Households, Firms, a single Bank and the State), which interacts on two different markets (labor market and goods market). 

It also features an evolutionnary mechanism based on mimetism and a mating-pool selection process. This adds a new layer of complexity and gives rise to interesting dynamics. 

For a more precise and formal description of the model, you can refer to my master thesis :

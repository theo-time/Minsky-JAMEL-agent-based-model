# Minsky-JAMEL-agent-based-model

This projecs aims to build an Macroeconomic Agent Based Model (MABM) in Javascript, mainly to study the dynamics of financialization and the cyclicality of the financial system. 
Contrary to aggregate models, ABMs  enable complex non-linear dynamics to emerge out of the decentralized interaction of a multiplicity of autonomous agents.

The model was largely inspired by JAMEL, an ABM model developed by Pascal Seppecher since 2009. It is composed of 4 types of agents (Households, Firms, a single Bank and the State), which interacts on three different markets (labor, goods and stocks). It features an evolutionnary mechanism based on mimetism and a mating-pool selection process, which adds a new layer of complexity and gives rise to interesting dynamics. 

For a more precise and formal description of the model, you can refer to my master thesis that you can find in the repository. 

Instructions to run the model :

- Run "index.html" on your favorite browser
- click on "boost" mode for quickier simulation speed
- I recommend pausing the model with space bar to go in the graphics sections and analyse results.

Any feedback would be much welcomed and feel free to contact me if you are interested to work on the project.
